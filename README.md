There is one level. The game window is a square that display 15 sprites in length, Mac Gyver is moving from sprite to sprite.
The structure (start, location of the walls, finish) is saved in a file to easily modify it if necessary.

The objects are distributed randomly in the maze and will change location if the user relaunches the game.
The objects are pick up if Mac Gyver goes on them.

MacGyver is controlled by the directional keys on the keyboard.
The program stops if MacGyver has retrieved all the objects and found the way out of the maze.
If he does not have all the objects and he appears in front of the guard, he dies.

To play you have to install the package(pip install requirements.txt) and pygame and launch the main.py file.
